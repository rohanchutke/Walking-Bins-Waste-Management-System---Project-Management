# Walking-Bins-Waste-Management-System---Project-Management
The report aims to develop an autonomous waste management system in the state of Victoria which sees an integration of a state-of-the-art Image Classification Machine Learning Algorithm with the auto-pilot sofware capabilities which is provided by a leading self-driven car vendor such as Tesla which would facilitate a way easier system for waste collection and disposal and also be environment-friendly at the same time. This project will eliminate the peopleâ€™s general habits of not wanting to segregate waste at a household level and also reduce the operational costs related to waste management. The current system has seen many failures over the years, contributing to a huge loss in terms of monetary value as well as environmental impacts to the government and the people of Victoria respectively. Hence, this project promises to replace the old, traditional system with a newer, improved one.
